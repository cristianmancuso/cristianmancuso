## ðŸš€ About Me
I studied Audiovisual Design, where I learned to use all the digital tools, edit videos, clean up audio, create logos, fliers, and so much more. In 2019, I completed the UX/UI Expert course. Since 2021, I have become very interested in programming, and have learned how to use various tools in this field. I find it incredibly fascinating as I am constantly learning new coding languages and strategies.


Nice to meet you! Here is a bit about me: I am a calm and creative person. I like challenging myself to learn and experience new things. I have lived in three different countries: Argentina, Spain, and The USA. I can speak Spanish and English. I enjoy sports, especially soccer, and spending time with my loved ones.
