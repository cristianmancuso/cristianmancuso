## ðŸš€ About Me
Nice to meet you! Here is a bit about me: I am a calm and creative person. I like challenging myself to learn and experience new things. I have lived in three different countries: Argentina, Spain, and The USA. I can speak Spanish and English. I enjoy sports, especially soccer, and spending time with my loved ones.
